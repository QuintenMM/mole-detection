# challenge-mole

# Description
This is a job we received from the company "skinCare".
The job entailed that we would develop a website that would be able to classify pictures of moles.

The dataset provided by the client is here https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000

# Future work
The model was overfitting by a lot.  
To improve accuracy there has to be looked at more data augmentation techniques  
to filter the images given to the model.
